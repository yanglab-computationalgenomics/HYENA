v.0.5.4
2024.03.25
Stable version.

Removed add noise function in add_noise.R and renamed it to normal_score.R. 
The results are more stable with less false positives.
Revised example.sh file, changed blank charaters to spaces. It used to be a 
mixture of tabs and spaces, may cause problem when copy and paste to command
line.

v.0.5.3
2022.05.18
Stable version.

Revised mapsv.R, added 7 parameters to control removal of small intra-chr SVs
and size cutoff, as well as removal of gene body SVs.

Revised HYENA.R, add_noise.R and pmt_exp.R, moved the normal score calculation 
and PCA from HYENA.R to add_noise.R. HYENA.R and pmt_exp.R now take Rdata
output by add_noise.R. This improved the speed dramatically.

Revised HYENA.R, fixed a bug for CNA matching with sample IDs.

Revised HYENA.R to take CNA input with samples as columns and genes as rows. It
speeds up the file loading.

Revised HYENA.R, fixed a bug that the 1st pc would be included in the regression
when --PC was used and -n was set to 0. Now if -n 0 is used, no pc will be 
included regardless of --PC.

Revised HYENA.R, fixed a bug so that the script will not crash if there is only
one gender in the cohort and sex is included in the regression model.

Revised HYENA.R, added the requirement of both sv group and no_sv group to have
at least 3 samples.

Revised HYENA.R, moved the gene expression matrices to intermediate folder.

Revised the expr_plotter.R to output expression fold change based on linear 
regression of log10(fpkm.qn) and draw fpkm-qn plot starting from 0.

Added plotting to example.sh.

Renamed expr_randomizer.R to pmt_exp.R.

Revised HYENA.R, changed option r to t.

Revised empiricalp.R, changed option r to p and pmt.

Some other minor revisions to reduce outputs.
